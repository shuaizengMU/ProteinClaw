# ProteinClaw

The AI agent for protein bioinformatics. Describe your research goal in plain English — ProteinClaw figures out which tools to call, runs them, and streams a synthesized answer back to you.

## Why ProteinClaw?

Protein research spans dozens of databases — UniProt, BLAST, ClinVar, gnomAD, GTEx, cBioPortal, and more. Moving data between them manually is slow, error-prone, and hard to reproduce.

ProteinClaw replaces that pipeline with a single conversational interface backed by a ReAct agent loop. You describe what you want; the agent decides which tools to call, calls them in sequence, and synthesizes the results into a coherent answer.

- **No scripting.** Natural language in, structured results out.
- **Multi-tool reasoning.** The agent chains tools automatically when your question requires it.
- **Streaming output.** See tool calls, intermediate observations, and the final answer as they happen.
- **Your LLM.** Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, MiniMax, or a local Ollama model.

## What's Included

### The Agent Core

A ReAct loop (`proteinclaw/core/agent/`) that drives all three interfaces:

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| `loop.py` | Thought → Tool Call → Observation cycle, up to 10 steps |
| `llm.py` | LiteLLM-based multi-model router with async streaming |
| `prompt.py` | System prompt builder — injects available tools at runtime |
| `events.py` | Typed event stream: `ToolCallEvent`, `ObservationEvent`, `TokenEvent`, `DoneEvent`, `ErrorEvent` |

### Three Interfaces

| Interface | How to launch | Best for |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Terminal UI** | `proteinclaw` | Interactive multi-turn research sessions |
| **One-shot CLI** | `proteinclaw query "..."` | Scripting, pipelines, quick lookups |
| **Desktop App** | Tauri `.dmg` / `.exe` | Non-technical users, GUI workflow |

### ProteinBox — the Tool Layer

All database integrations live in `proteinbox/api_tools/`. Each tool is independently testable and auto-discovered by the agent at startup. 53 tools across 15 categories. See [Supported Tools](#supported-tools) for the full list.

## Usage Examples

### Comprehensive Research Demo — EGFR from every angle

A single interactive session walking through all tool categories. The agent automatically chains tools based on each question.
